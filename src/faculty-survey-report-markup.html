<!--SECTION 1 - Fall 2020 plans and faculty perspectives-->
<h4>Section 1</h4>
<h1>Planning amidst uncertainty</h1>
<p>It wasn’t that long ago that many institutions were cautiously optimistic about a return to the campus classroom. But with COVID-19 cases spiking, plans for the fall have continued to evolve. Adopting a ‘wait-and-see’ approach, a small number of institutions have held off from announcing plans altogether. This, along with the very real possibility of school’s closing shortly after reopening has left many faculty members in a state of flux, preparing as best they can for new teaching modalities amid ongoing uncertainty. </p>

<!--Section 1: Part A-->
<h2>Confused, angry, confident—the emotional rollercoaster continues</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>Most faculty have spent the past few months preparing for the fall against a backdrop of institutional belt tightening, including layoffs, pay cuts and benefit reductions at many schools. Under the shadow of COVID-19, health and safety are top of mind, with one respondent noting, “it would be foolish and dangerous” to return to the classroom as the pandemic continues.</p>
	<p>While these issues have left many respondents feeling uncertain, confused, angry and sad, those who feel their institutions have been more decisive and took steps to prepare early tell a different story. For these individuals, there is the sense of calm acceptance and even confidence as faculty and institutions make a monumental effort to gear up to teach online. </p>

<h2>What teaching will look like in fall 2020</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>Despite earlier hopes for a return to the classroom, only a small percentage (11 percent) of respondents plan to teach in person. Twenty-seven percent plan to teach entirely online, with 37 percent planning to use hybrid approaches, combining in-person and online teaching to engage students. Hyflex, which has spurred much debate in academic circles, is one of the least likely approaches (7 percent) to be used this fall. With the start of the academic year just around the corner, 4 percent of respondents indicated their school had still not announced how they would be accommodating students. </p>
</div>

<!--Section 1 : PartC-->
<h2>Institutions scrape by with a passing grade on fall 2020 planning</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>Overall, respondents have reacted favorably to their school’s plans for the coming semester (XX percent). Many have applauded a ‘we’re in this together’ attitude, remarking that faculty and staff have worked together to make the fall transition easier for students. Yet almost 40 percent are not quite so charitable. A lack of clear direction has weighed on many while others remain deeply concerned about the risk to students and staff posed by teaching during a pandemic. </p>
</div>

<h4>How would you rate the level of clarity your school has provided regarding its plans for teaching students in the fall academic term?</h4>

23.3% excellent

<h2>The COVID-19 risk factor looms</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>Regarding the risks of COVID-19, the majority of respondents feel well supported—65 percent said their institutions were taking health and safety seriously, while 61 percent admitted their schools were accommodating their personal needs. Listening to employees and partnering with local health authorities to develop policies and procedures has helped assuage concerns for many. Yet roughly one third feel their schools have done a fair or poor job in these areas. Adding to this, juggling caregiving (20 percent) and maintaining a good state of mental (45 percent) and physical health (40 percent) are top concerns.</p>

<h2>Not all institutions rising to the challenge</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>For almost 30 percent of satisfied respondents, the Herculean efforts undertaken by their institutions to prepare for the fall have not gone unnoticed. Staff training and support, clear, decisive action and embracing approaches that demonstrate care for students and faculty have played a role in winning hearts and minds. However, for almost one quarter of respondents (23 percent), the perception of their school has become worse as the crisis has unfolded. Concern for at-risk students, and, as several respondents noted, basing decisions on financial considerations as opposed to human needs have contributed to the negative view.</p>

<!--Section 2 - Student connection and community -->
<h4>Section 2</h4>
<h1>The importance and challenge of creating community</h1>
<p>The success of every student is closely tied to the sense of connection they feel with their peers and professors. But with so much uncertainty surrounding the fall semester, and institutions shifting to online and blended learning formats, having the tools to create meaningful connections, humanize the learning experience and build community inside and outside the virtual or physical classroom is more important than ever.</p>

<!--Section 2 : Part A-->
<h2>Humanizing the learning experience</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>Generally speaking, respondents have a favorable view of their ability to stay connected with their students, a sentiment echoed by students in our spring 2020 student survey. However, faculty are much less confident in the ability of their students to stay connected with one another. Absent tools designed to support collaboration and interaction between students, this may jeopardize efforts to create a sense of community inside and outside the ‘classroom.’</p>
</div>

<h4>How important is fostering a sense of community amongst students in your classes? </h4>
Average: 3.4
1: 4.5% - Not important
2: 9.1%
3: 28.4%
4: 58.1% - Very important
<h4>How would you rate your students’ ability to stay connected with fellow classmates? </h4>
Average: 2 on a 4 pt scale
1: 23% - Low ability
2: 35%
3: 29%
4: 13% - High ability


<!--Section 2 : Part B-->
<h2>When it comes to building community, there’s work to be done</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>During the rush to emergency remote teaching in the spring, instructors employed a number of strategies to support—and stay connected with—students. These efforts emphasized increasing the frequency and depth of academic interactions (49 and 31 percent, respectively), and using video messages to humanize the learning experience (46 percent).</p>
	<p>Yet students also want to connect with peers and this looks to have been a much smaller area of focus for faculty, with only 17 percent of respondents putting energy into creating a non-academic social community, encouraging students to exchange video messages (10 percent) or creating optional social media groups for their classes (7 percent).</p>
</div>

<h4>If you taught in the last academic term, what strategies did you use to stay connected with students online? Select all that apply. </h4>
<ul class="statistic-list statistic-list--grid">
	<li class="statistic-item"><span class="statistic-value">49%</span> <span class="statistic-label">increased frequency of academic interactions</span></li>

</ul>

<!--Section 2 : Part C-->
<h2>The ‘talk’ on student connection and community doesn’t match the ‘walk’ </h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>Given the importance of building community in the classroom, it is noteworthy that the majority of faculty said they have received little-to-no institutional support on how to do this well. Only 42 percent of respondents said the support they have received focused on building connections between themselves and their students while roughly one third (34 percent) indicated that learning how to build connections among students was a significant focus. With the dropout rate for students enrolled in online courses anywhere from 10 to 20 percent higher than traditional courses <super>3</super>, this area may not be receiving the attention it deserves.</p>

<!--Section 3 - Keeping students engaged virtually -->
<h4>Section 3</h4>
<h1>Forced online, faculty rethink the way they teach</h1>
<p>Perhaps the largest challenge confronting instructors in the spring scramble to online teaching was keeping students engaged in the learning process. A return to the ‘sage-on-the-stage’ model of lecturing, this time through a video stream, left many students feeling disconnected and less motivated to complete their coursework <super>1<super>. These concerns have not gone away. But there are encouraging signs as instructors embrace pedagogies like active learning that put engagement and learning outcomes at the heart of the student experience.</p>

<!--Section 3 : Part A-->
<h2>Student engagement is a common concern</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>The vast majority of respondents (81 percent) express concerns about ensuring students stay motivated and engaged before, during and after class. Fifty-eight percent are worried about creating an engaging in-class experience while 49 percent are concerned about providing students with opportunities for experiential or hands-on learning. A slight majority (54 percent) are worried that the chosen teaching modality may not meet the needs of at-risk students, who may fail or drop out altogether.</p>
</div>

<h4>What are your biggest concerns about the expected modality in the fall (in-person, online, hybrid, HyFlex) as it relates to your ability to teach effectively? Select all that apply. </h4>

</ul>

<!--Section 3 : Part B-->
<h2>Active learning moves to the fore</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>Amajority (68 percent) of faculty agree that the training they have received aligns to pedagogies strongly associated with improved student engagement and learning outcomes. This bodes well for delivering on the increased expectations students have relative to the emergency shift to remote teaching that took place in the spring. Active learning in particular promotes deep understanding, critical thinking and subject mastery through collaboration and by challenging individuals to apply what they are learning.</p>
</div>

<h4>Do you agree that the training and support you have received aligns to best practices associated with ‘active learning’ or ‘student-centered’ learning?</h4>
20.6% strongly agree
48.4% agree

7.4% strong disagree


<!--Section 3 : Part C-->
<h2>Faculty lack the tools to keep students engaged </h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>Given the importance of teaching online, faculty support has emphasized learning how to use tools to teach synchronously and asynchronously. But when it comes to learning how to use digital learning tools to engage students, a gap emerges. Only about a third of respondents said that learning how to use tools to engage students in real time (44 percent) and outside of class environments (39 percent) comprised the training they received to a significant extent. This is hardly encouraging given the lacklustre experience of many students in the spring. In the midst of campus closures, students said the lack of an engaging in-class experience had made it difficult to adjust to online learning <super>2</super>.</p>

<!--SECTION 4 - Technology adoption for the virtual classroom-->

<h4>Section 4</h4>
<h1>Uneven technology adoption raises concerns for student success</h1>
<p>In these changing times, technology has become essential to deliver an engaging and effective educational experience. Relying on patchwork solutions may have sufficed in the shift to emergency remote teaching, but students this fall will be far less tolerant of the poor, disjointed remote learning they received in the spring. Raising the bar will require a heavy reliance on tools purpose-built to humanize the learning experience and support approaches to teaching that involve students as active participants.</p>

<!--Section 4 : Part A-->
<h2>An LMS alone is not sufficient for effective online teaching</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>While seventy-five percent of respondents make use of an LMS in all of their classes, eight percent are inconsistent in their usage while 11 percent do not use an LMS at all and six percent are learning to use an LMS. The lack of an LMS or inconsistent usage may present challenges by denying students a homebase to access learning materials and other academic resources.</p>
	<p>In addition to an LMS, roughly 80 percent of instructors use other digital teaching tools in at least some or all of their classes, suggesting an LMS by itself is not sufficient for most instructors. A combined 14 percent of respondents do not use an LMS or other digital teaching tools while 18 percent are still learning to use an LMS and other digital teaching tools. This is some cause for concern given the expectation that most courses will be taught online in the fall in at least some capacity.</p>
</div>

<h4>How often do you use a Learning Management System (LMS) like Canvas to teach?</h4>
75% - I use my LMS in all of their classes
8% - I use my LMS in some of my classes
6% - I am still learning to use my LMS
11% - I do not use an LMS in my classes

<h4>How often do you use teaching tools other than your LMS?</h4>
53% - I use digital teaching tools in all my classes
27% - I use digital teaching tools in some of my classes
12% - I am still learning how to use other digital teaching tools
8% - I typically do not incorporate digital tools into my classes


<!--Section 4 : Part B-->
<h2>Inconsistency reigns in choosing the right tools for the job</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>When it comes to adopting tools for teaching, academic freedom still reigns supreme for 32 percent of respondents. Only 18 percent indicated that their institution had mandated the teaching tools and technologies they will be using in the fall, while for 31 percent, some direction has been provided. A lack of mandated technology presents a number of challenges, including an inconsistent learning experience for students across different courses. For faculty, the lack of standardization creates inefficiencies in terms of the work involved in choosing, adopting, navigating and, ultimately, supporting a number of different tools.</p>
</div>

<h4>Has your school mandated the teaching tools and technologies you will use in the fall academic term?</h4>
Yes: 18%
Some: 31%

<!--Section 4 : Part C-->
<h2>Technology concerns for students</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>Given the heavy reliance on digital tools to teach this fall, the mixed picture on technology adoption has raised concerns among faculty when it comes to the student experience. More than half worry about students being able to navigate and use online teaching tools while 41 percent list students’ ability to access online teaching materials as one of their biggest concerns. Student equity issues are also top of mind with 61 percent expressing concerns about students having reliable computer access and 64 percent citing reliable internet access as another potential stumbling block.</p>

<!--SECTION 5 - Faculty preparedness and outlook-->
<h4>Section 5</h4>
<h1>Gearing up for an unprecedented semester</h1>
<p>Faculty and administrators have had little time to catch their breath as they pivot to online and blended learning formats for the fall semester. According to our respondents, the effort has been met with mixed results. This includes developing the necessary proficiencies as well as accommodating the health and safety of students and faculty in the face of the ongoing pandemic. Just as concerning is the lack of confidence that students will be successful or see value in their higher education investment.</p>

<!--Section 5 : Part A-->
<h2>Institutional support gets mixed results</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>Institutions and faculty have made significant investments to prepare for new approaches to teaching this fall. Forty-two percent have spent more than 40 hours on formal or self-paced training, while 40 percent have invested a minimum of 10 to 20 hours. Although 62 percent were generally positive about the quality of the support they received, 37 percent of respondents provided a less than favorable view. This may suggest that having survived the spring shift to emergency remote teaching, instructors are now more exacting in their expectations.</p>
</div>

<h4>Thinking only of the formal and self-directed training you’ve undertaken, how many hours has the change in circumstances required you to prepare to teach for the fall academic term?</h4>
42% - 40+ hours
21% - 20 to 40 hrs
19% - 10 to 20 hours
15% - 1 to 10 hours
2% - 0 hours

<h4>How would you rate the overall quality of support provided by your school to help you teach effectively and help students succeed in the fall academic term?</h4>
22% excellent
40% good
26% fair
11% poor


<!--Section 5 : Part B-->
<h2>Learning the tools of the trade</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>For more than 50 percent of respondents, learning to use tools to teach synchronously—or live online—has been a significant component of the training they have received. Similarly, learning to use tools to teach asynchronously online has been an important area of focus. Of some concern are the 40 percent and 38 percent of respondents who indicated that learning to use tools to teach synchronously and asynchronously, respectively, has either been a small or non-existent part of the training they’ve received.</p>

<!--Section 5 : Part C-->
<h2>Faculty are confident...to an extent</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>The good news is that the majority of faculty express confidence in their ability to support the approach to teaching being embraced for the coming academic term. That said, roughly one third (32 percent) are not so self-assured. Due to gaps in training coupled with the lack of direction with respect to the tools needed to teach online, many faculty members may not be well prepared to support new teaching modalities for the semester ahead.</p>
</div>

<h4>How confident are you in your ability to support the approach to teaching described in the previous question?</h4>
32% very confident
34% confident
27% some confidence
5% not at all confident

<!--Section 5 : Part D-->
<h2>Will students see value? Will they be successful?</h2>
<div class="callout-box callout-box--small callout-box--transparent">
	<p>While many faculty and administrators are confident in their ability to support their school’s approach to teaching, only a small percentage of respondents are very confident (13 percent) that students will see the value in their higher education investment. Equally concerning are the 46 percent of respondents who express at least some level of doubt that students will be successful as learners based on the formats announced for the fall semester.</p>

<h4>Based on your school’s plan for the fall academic term, how confident are you that your students will see the value of their higher education investment?</h4>
